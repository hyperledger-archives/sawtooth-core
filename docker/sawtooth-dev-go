# A PR was merged into the github.com/golang/mock repository on 10/10/17 that
# broke it due to an import issue. Since the "go get" command does not support
# checking out specific commits/tags/branches, the above hack was used instead
# to retrieve the dependency and checkout a stable version. The following was
# created to track the issue: https://github.com/golang/mock/issues/116. Once
# the issue is resolved, we can revert to using "go get" again with the paths:
# - github.com/golang/mock/gomock
# - github.com/golang/mock/mockgen
