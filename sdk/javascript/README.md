# Hyperledger Sawtooth SDK

*Hyperledger Sawtooth* is an enterprise solution for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers (also called blockchains). It provides an extremely modular and flexible platform for implementing transaction-based updates to shared state between untrusted parties coordinated by consensus algorithms.

The *Sawtooth SDK* provides a number of useful components that simplify developing JavaScript applications which interface with the Sawtooth platform. These include modules to create and sign Transactions, read state, and  create Transaction Processors. For full usage and installation instructions please reference the official Sawtooth documentation below:
