// that implementers of TransactionProcessors can define their own mappings
// from their native object ids to merkle trie addresses.

// The default implementation uses a SHA512 hash to map both the key and the
// namespace to the merkle trie address. Collisions in the key mappings should
// be uncommon but still possible, data storage behind the keys.
//
// Each instance of the mapper holds a namespace that is mapped to a
// namespace prefix when it is constructed. If your transaction processor
// operates on multiple namespaces, it is recommended that you use an instance
// for each namespace.
