  title: Sawtooth REST API
  description: |
    _This HTTP pragmatic REST API is built on top of Sawtooth's
    existing ZMQ/Protobuf infrastructure, simplifying client
    interaction with the blockchain by exposing endpoints that
    use common HTTP/JSON standards._

paths:
  /batches:
    post:
      summary: Sends a BatchList to the validator
      description: |
        Accepts a protobuf formatted `BatchList` as an octet-stream binary
        file and submits it to the validator to be committed.

        The API will return immediately with a status of `202`. There will be
        no `data` object, only a `link` to a `/batch_statuses` endpoint to be
        polled to check the status of submitted batches.

  /batch_statuses:
    get:
      summary: Fetches the committed statuses for a set of batches
      description: |
        Fetches an array of objects with a status and id for each batch
        requested. There are four possible statuses with string values
        `'COMMITTED'`, `'INVALID'`, `'PENDING'`, and `'UNKNOWN'`.

        The batch(es) you want to check can be specified using the `id` filter
        parameter. If a `wait` time is specified in the URL, the API will wait
        to respond until all batches are committed, or the time in seconds has
        elapsed. If the value of `wait` is not set (i.e., `?wait&id=...`), or
        it is set to any non-integer value other than `false`, the wait time
        will be just under the API's specified timeout (usually 300).

        Note that because this route does not return full resources, the
        response will not be paginated, and there will be no `head` or
        `paging` properties.
