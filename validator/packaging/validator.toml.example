# Sawtooth Lake -- Validator Configuration
#

# This file should exist in the defined config directory and allows
# validators to be configured without the need for command line options.

# The following is a possible example.

# Bind is used to set the network and component endpoints. It should be a list
# of strings in the format "option:endpoint", where the options are currently
# network and component.
bind = [
  "network:tcp://127.0.0.1:8800",
  "component:tcp://127.0.0.1:40000"
]

# The type of peering approach the validator should take. Choices are 'static'
# which only attempts to peer with candidates provided with the peers option,
# and 'dynamic' which will do topology buildouts. If 'dynamic' is provided,
# any static peers will be processed first, prior to the topology buildout
# starting.
peering = "static"

# Advertised network endpoint URL.
endpoint = "tcp://127.0.0.1:8800"

# Uri(s) to connect to in order to initially connect to the validator network,
# in the format tcp://hostname:port. This is not needed in static peering mode
# and defaults to None.
seeds = ["tcp://127.0.0.1:8801"]

# A list of peers to attempt to connect to in the format tcp://hostname:port.
# It defaults to None.
peers = ["tcp://127.0.0.1:8801"]
