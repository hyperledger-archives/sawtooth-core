Reporting Issues
================

This is a great way to contribute. Before reporting an issue, please review current
open issues to see if there are any matches. If there is a match, comment with a +1, or "Also seeing this issue".
If any environment details differ, please add those with your comment to the matching issue.

When reporting an issue, details are key. Include the following:
- OS version
- Distributed Ledger version
- Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Actual results
- Expected results

JIRA
====

We use JIRA as our issue tracking system.  The JIRA instance is hosted by
the Hyperledger Project, and Sawtooth uses the key *STL*:

  https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/STL/issues/

To report issues, you will need to login to JIRA, which requires a
Linux Foundation account.  To setup a Linux Foundation account, go to:

  https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/

How to Report an Issue
======================

Issues should be created in JIRA under the Sawtooth project (which
uses the *STL* JIRA key).

Before reporting an issue, please review current open issues to see if there
are any matches. If there is a match, comment with a +1, or "Also seeing this
issue".  If any environment details differ, please add those with your comment
to the matching issue.

If you would like, you could also bring up the issue on :ref:`chat`
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it.  If possible, provide instructions for how to reproduce the
issue within the vagrant development environment.
