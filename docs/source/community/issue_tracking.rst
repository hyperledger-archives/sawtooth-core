Reporting Issues
================

This is a great way to contribute. Before reporting an issue, please review current
open issues to see if there are any matches.

How to Report an Issue
======================

Issues should be created in JIRA under the Hyperledger Sawtooth project
(which uses the *STL* JIRA key).

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it.  If possible, provide instructions for how to reproduce the
issue within the vagrant development environment.

Details are key. Please include the following:

* OS version
* Distributed Ledger version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce
* Actual results
* Expected results

If you would like, you could also bring up the issue on :ref:`chat`
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.
