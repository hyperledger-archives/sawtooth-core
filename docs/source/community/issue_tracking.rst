Tracking Issues

A great way to contribute is by reporting issues. Before reporting an issue,
please review the current open issues to see if someone has already reported
the issue.

Using JIRA

How to Report an Issue
======================

To report issues, log into `jira.hyperledger.org
<https://jira.hyperledger.org>`_, which requires a
`Linux Foundation Account <https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/>`_.

Create issues in JIRA under the Hyperledger Sawtooth project,
which uses the ``STL`` JIRA key.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it. If possible, explain how to reproduce the issue.
Details are very helpful. Please include the following information:

* OS version

If you would like, you could also describe the issue on RocketChat
(see :doc:`join_the_discussion`)
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.
