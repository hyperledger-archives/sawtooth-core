This guide explains how to install, configure, and run Hyperledger Sawtooth
on a Ubuntu system for proof-of-concept or production use in a Sawtooth network.

It includes steps to configure a consensus mechanism, using PoET simulator
consensus as an example, and to start the Sawtooth components as services.

It also includes optional procedures to change the user, client, and validator
permissions; set up a proxy for the REST API; and configure Grafana to display
Sawtooth metrics.

.. note::

   The instructions in this guide have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 only.
