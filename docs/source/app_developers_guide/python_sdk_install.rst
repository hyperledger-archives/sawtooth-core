Python SDK Installation
***********************

Overview
========

The Python SDK is installed automatically when you install Hyperledger
Sawtooth by following the instructions in :doc:`installing_sawtooth`. This
tutorial explains how import the SDK into your Python environment.


Prerequisites
=============

The Sawtooth Python SDK requires Python version 3.5 or higher.

.. note::

    If you install Sawtooth as described in :doc:`installing_sawtooth`, using the method
    described in :doc:`ubuntu`, then Python is installed
    for you automatically if it is not already installed.


Importing the SDK
=================

As part of the installation process, the Python SDK is installed and made available through
the standard Python import system. From the Python REPL, for example, you could import
the SDK and then view the SDK's docstring:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import sawtooth_sdk
    >>> help(sawtooth_sdk)
    Help on package sawtooth_sdk:
