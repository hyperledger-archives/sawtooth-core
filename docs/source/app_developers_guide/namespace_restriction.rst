Namespace Restriction
*********************

A transaction family is defined by a set of parameters including a
name, some version numbers, an *apply* function and namespaces. The
apply function is what defines the behavior of a transaction family
according to the `get` and `set` operations on addresses of the Global
State. The goal of having a family declaring namespaces is to indicate
the subset of addresses it will use for its `get` (read, inputs) and
`set` (write, outputs) operations. It is important to remember that the
namespace is not necessarily a 1-to-1 relationship between namespaces and
transaction families.  Some transaction families like :doc:`Settings
Transaction Family
<../transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family>` or
:doc:`BlockInfo Transaction Family
<../transaction_family_specifications/blockinfo_transaction_family>`
write data at addresses that other transaction families could use,
like a specific on-chain setting, or the timestamp of the latest
block. Nevertheless, for security reasons, it is important to make
sure transaction families cannot write data at addresses that is only
intended to be read. This is the goal of the *namespace restriction*
feature, when explicitly activated, the
validators verify that transaction processors only perform `set`
operations whose addresses have a prefix in common with one of the
familyâ€™s specified namespace prefix(es). By default and for better
flexibility, this namespace restriction is not enforced by the
validators, but when activated, this feature augments enforcement of
the transaction processors declaration done during registration.


In order to activate some namespace restrictions,
appropriate settings must be published on-chain using the
:doc:`Settings Transaction Family
<../transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family>`.
For every block, a validator loads the JSON data stored under the
specific key ``sawtooth.validator.transaction_families``.  At this
key the data is a list of JSON entries, one per transaction family,
possibly including its namespaces. When a transaction family entry
includes namespaces, the validator enforces that the corresponding
transaction processor only writes at addresses with a prefix matching
at least one of the namespaces.

Here is an example in which the namespaces are set for the transaction
families ``block_info``, ``sawtooth_settings`` and ``intkey``:

.. code-block:: python

  sawtooth.validator.transaction_families='[
    {\"family\": \"block_info\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"namespaces\": [\"00b10c\"]},
    {\"family\":\"sawtooth_settings\", \"version\":\"1.0\"},
    {\"family\": \"intkey\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"namespaces\": [\"1cf126\"]} ]'

In the case where a family has no ``"namespaces"``, the validator does
not restrict the write permission of the family. In the example above,
the family `sawtooth_settings` does not indicate any namespace and
therefore the validator will let it write at any address. This is
legitimate for :doc:`transaction
families<../transaction_family_specifications>` which are reviewed thoroughly,
like the ones included in Sawtooth.
