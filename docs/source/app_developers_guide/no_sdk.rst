Development Without an SDK
**************************

Hyperledger Sawtooth provides SDKs in a variety of languages to handle
a great deal of complexity and simplify developing applications for this
platform. The recommended way to work with Sawtooth is through
:doc:`one of these SDKs <using_the_sdks>`. However, if there is no SDK for your
language of choice, if the SDK is missing functionality, or if you want a deeper
understanding of what is going on underneath the hood, use this guide to learn
how to develop a Sawtooth application without the help of an SDK.

.. note::

   This guide uses Python 3 for the code examples, because Python 3 provides a
   concrete demonstration in a common, readable language. The information in
   these examples applies to almost any language. Note that actual Python
   development should typically use the :doc:`Python SDK <python_sdk>`.
