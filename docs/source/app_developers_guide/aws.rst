*********************
Using Sawtooth on AWS
*********************

.. Important::

  The procedures in this section require an existing Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  account. If you don't have one yet, Amazon provides free accounts so you can
  demo the platform. `Click here <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`_ to sign up.

This document guides you through the process of setting up Hyperledger Sawtooth
for application development using AWS, introduces some of the basic Sawtooth
concepts necessary for application development, and walks through performing
the following tasks:

* Launching and connecting to an EC2 instance running Sawtooth
* Starting a Sawtooth validator and related components
* Submitting transactions to the REST API
* Viewing blocks, transactions, and state with the sawtooth CLI tool

Upon completion of this section, you will be prepared for subsequent sections
that describe application development topics, such as implementing business
logic with transaction families and writing clients which use Sawtooth's REST
API.


Overview of Sawtooth Components
===============================

A running Sawtooth network consists of the following applications or processes:

.. image:: ../images/hyperledger_sawtooth_components.*
   :width: 80%
   :align: center
   :alt: Sawtooth components

This diagram represents a simple network with just two validators and two
transaction processors. The second validator's transaction processors are not
depicted.


Launching a Sawtooth Instance
=============================

Lauch your instance from the
`Sawtooth product page <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B075TKQCC2>`_
on the AWS Marketplace. Detailed instructions for
Launching an AWS Marketplace Instance can
be found `here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launch-marketplace-console.html>`_.

.. note::

  The default security group with recommended settings for Sawtooth is
  configured to only allow ssh traffic inbound.

  * If you'd like to attach a transaction processor remotely, you'll need
    to add an inbound rule allowing TCP traffic on port 4004.

  * If you'd like to access the REST API remotely, you'll need to add an
    inbound rule allowing TCP traffic on port 8080.

  Please see Amazon's `Security Groups
  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#AddRemoveRules>`_
  documentation for assitance with editing security group rules.

Logging In to the Sawtooth Instance
===================================

Follow the Amazon guide `Connect to Your Linux Instance
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html>`_
to log in to the instance you just launched. Use the username
``ubuntu`` when connecting.

Once you've sucessfully logged in, continue to the next section.

Using Sawtooth with the CLI Commands
====================================

Creating And Submitting Transactions with intkey
------------------------------------------------

The ``intkey`` CLI command is provided to create sample transactions of the
intkey transaction type for testing purposes. Using it you will be able prepare
batches of intkey transactions that *set* a few keys to random values, then
randomly *inc* (increment) and *dec* (decrement) those values. These batches
will be saved locally, and then can then be submitted to the validator.

To use, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ intkey create_batch --count 10 --key-count 5
  Writing to batches.intkey...
  $ intkey load
  batches: 11 batch/sec: 141.7800162868952

This output doesn't tell us much, so let's take a look at the validator and
intkey logs in ``/var/log/sawtooth``.

The validator logs show that state is being updated and a new block
has been published.

The intkey logs show values being incremented and decremented.

.. note::

  Some log file names contain a string to make the file names unique. The
  file names on your system may be different than the examples below.

.. code-block:: console

Submitting Transactions with sawtooth batch submit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can also submit transactions, including intkey transactions, with the
``sawtooth batch submit`` command.

For example, submit the transactions in the file ``batches.intkey`` generated above
with this command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth batch submit -f batches.intkey


Viewing the Block Chain
-----------------------

You can view the blocks stored in the blockchain using the ``sawtooth block``
command.

.. note::

  The sawtooth CLI provides help for all subcommands. For example, to get help
  for the ``block`` subcommand, enter the command ``sawtooth block -h``.

Viewing the List of Blocks
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enter the command ``sawtooth block list`` to view the blocks stored by the state:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth block list

The output of the command will be similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

Viewing a Particular Block
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the output generated by the ``sawtooth block list`` command, copy the id
of a block you want to get more info about, then paste it in place of
``{BLOCK_ID}`` in the ``sawtooth block show`` command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth block show {BLOCK_ID}

The output of this command includes all data stored under that block, and can be
quite long. It should look something like this:

.. code-block:: console

Viewing Global State
--------------------

Viewing List of Nodes (Addresses)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the command ``sawtooth state list`` to list the nodes in the Merkle tree:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth state list

The output of the command will be similar to this truncated list:

.. code-block:: console

  ADDRESS                                                                                                                                SIZE DATA

Viewing Data at an Address
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the output generated by the ``sawtooth state list`` command, copy the
address you want to view, then paste it in place of ``{STATE_ADDRESS}``
in the ``sawtooth state show`` command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth state show {STATE_ADDRESS}


The output of the command will include both the bytes stored at that address,
and the block id of the *chain head* the current state is tied to. It should
look similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

  DATA: "b'\xa1fcCTdcH\x192B'"
  HEAD: "0c4364c6d5181282a1c7653038ec9515cb0530c6bfcb46f16e79b77cb524491676638339e8ff8e3cc57155c6d920e6a4d1f53947a31dc02908bcf68a91315ad5"


Connecting To The REST API
==========================

Use ``curl`` to confirm that you can connect to the REST API from the host.

Enter the following command from a terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl http://localhost:8080/blocks


Configuring the List of Transaction Families
============================================

Sawtooth provides a :doc:`Settings transaction family
<../transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family>` that stores
on-chain settings, along with a Settings family transaction processor written
in Python.

.. note::

  Sawtooth supports multiple languages for transaction processor development and
  includes additional transaction processors written in several languages.
  The following lists the processors that are included:

  * settings-tp - A settings family transaction processor written in Python

  * intkey-tp-go - An intkey transaction processor written in Go

  * intkey-tp-java - An intkey transaction processor written in Java

  * intkey-tp-javascript - An intkey transaction processor written in JavaScript
    (requires node.js)

  * jvm-sc-tp - An intkey transaction processor implemented as a smart contract;
    the bytecode to run a transaction is stored in state and the blockchain
    (requires Java)

  * poet-validator-registry-tp - A transaction family used by the PoET consensus
    algorithm implementation to keep track of other validators

  * xo-tp-javascript - An XO transaction processor written in JavaScript
    (requires node.js)

  * xo-tp-python - An XO transaction processor written in Python

One of the on-chain settings is the list of supported transaction families.
The next step describes how to configure this setting with a single command.

Changing the Transaction Family Settings
----------------------------------------

In the example below, a JSON array is submitted to the `sawtooth config`
command, which creates and submits a batch of transactions containing the
settings change.

The JSON array used tells the validator or validator network to accept
transactions of the following types:

* intkey
* sawtooth_settings

To create and submit the batch containing the new settings, enter the
following commands at a Linux command-line prompt:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sawtooth config proposal create sawtooth.validator.transaction_families='[{"family": "intkey", "version": "1.0", "encoding": "application/cbor"}, {"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0", "encoding":"application/protobuf"}]'

A TP_PROCESS_REQUEST message appears in the logging output of the validator,
and output similar to the following appears in the ``validator-debug.log``
file:

.. code-block:: console

  [21:11:55.356 [Thread-9] tp_state_handlers DEBUG] GET: [('000000a87cb5eafdcca6a8cde0fb0dec1400c5ab274474a6aa82c12840f169a04216b7',b'\nl\n&sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys\x12B03e3ccf73dd618ef1abe18da84d3cf5838a5d292d36ef8857a60b5ad04fd4ab517')]

Sawtooth Setup Service
======================

The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Sawtooth has a systemd service
that handles some environment setup steps such as generating keys and creating
a genesis block so you can get started more quickly. If you'd like to learn
more about how the typical startup process works, see :doc:`ubuntu`.

Resetting the Environment
-------------------------

You can use the following commands to reset the environment if you're
uncertain about the state or would simply like to start over. Removing the
``config-genesis.batch`` and  restarting the ``sawtooth-setup`` service will
clean up your validator, create a new genesis block and restart the
``sawtooth-validator`` service so you're ready to build on a new chain.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo rm /var/lib/sawtooth/config-genesis.batch
  $ sudo systemctl restart sawtooth-setup.service
