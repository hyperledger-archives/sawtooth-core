Remember that *inputs* and *outputs* are state addresses that the Transaction is allowed to read from or write to (see TransactionHeaders in :doc:`/architecture/transactions_and_batches`). In this case we used a six character prefix rather than full 70-character addresses, allowing us to work with any address in the IntKey subtree. Also remember that *dependencies* are the *header signatures* of Transactions that must be committed before ours (none in this case).
