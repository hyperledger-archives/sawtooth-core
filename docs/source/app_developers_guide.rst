Application Developer's Guide
*****************************

This guide covers development of applications which run on top of the
Hyperledger Sawtooth :term:`core platform<Sawtooth core>`, primarily through
the use of Sawtooth's provided SDKs and :term:`REST API`. Topics include
development of :term:`transaction families<Transaction family>` and associated
client programs. Transaction families codify business rules used to modify
state, while client programs typically submit transactions and view state.

SDKs are provided in several languages: C++, Go, Java, Javascript, and Python.
