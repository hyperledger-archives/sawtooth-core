Getting Started
***************

Getting Seth
============

Currently, Seth has not been wrapped up in a convenient package, so the best way
run Seth is to build it from source. Building Seth requires an environment that
has the Docker Engine installed and that can run bash scripts.

To get Seth, clone the Sawtooth repo and then build the seth portion of the
project and the core portion of the project written in Python::

    $ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core
    $ cd sawtooth-core/
    $ ./bin/build_all -t seth -t python

Starting Up Seth
================

This will produce a number of Docker images that we will use to interact with
Seth and Sawtooth. The repo also includes a Docker Compose file for starting up
a development environment based on these Docker images. To start the
environment, do::

    $ docker-compose -f docker/compose/sawtooth-seth.yaml up

This starts up all the components necessary to begin interacting with Seth. Each
of the components is started inside of a Docker container. The following ports
are exposed on the host for interacting with the containers once startup is
complete:

+-----------+--------------------------+
| Host Port | Service                  |
+===========+==========================+
|   8080    | Sawtooth REST API Server |
+-----------+--------------------------+
|   3030    | Seth-RPC Server          |
+-----------+--------------------------+

You can verify that these services are working by submitting an HTTP request to
them. For the REST API, do::

    $ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/blocks

You should receive a JSON object containing a list of blocks. For the Seth-RPC
server, do::

    $ curl http://0.0.0.0:3030 -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

You should receive a JSON object with the number of the current block, in hex,
in the "result" key.

Creating an Account
===================

Generating a Key Pair
---------------------

In order to interact with Seth, we need to create an external account on the
network. Creating an account is equivalent to generating a new private key that
Seth can understand. Seth accepts secp256k1 private keys in one of two formats:

- A plaintext base58 encoded private key, such as those generated by
  ``sawtooth keygen``.
- A PEM encoded private key with or without a password, such as those generated
  with the ``openssl`` command.

The following shows you how to generate a PEM encoded key that has been
encrypted with a password. If you would like to use a private key generated with
the `sawtooth keygen` command, it must be in the sawtooth-core/ directory that
you ran docker-compose from, because this is the only host directory mounted on
the seth docker container.

OpenSSL is already installed in the Docker container running the Seth-RPC
server, so we can just connect to the container and run the command from there.
Do the following to start up a shell in that container::

    $ docker exec -it seth bash

You should now be logged in as root in the container and your working directory
should be /project/sawtooth-core. As mentioned above, this is the sawtooth-core
directory on your host, so any files created in this directory will persist
after the container is destroyed. From this shell, you can generate a new,
password-encrypted key with the following::

    $ openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -out mykey.pem -aes128

You can use any encryption cipher by changing the final `-aes128` flag or omit
the flag and to generate a key without it being encrypted.

Now we are ready to set up the account on the network. To do this, we need to
use the `seth` command. From the prompt where you generated the key, run::

    $ seth account import mykey.pem myalias

This will copy your key to an internal directory and create an alias for the key
which you will use to reference the key in future commands. Finally, to submit
a transaction to the network to create your account, do::

    $ seth account create myalias --wait

The command should print the address of your newly created account upon success.
This will be a (40 character) hex string. You can verify that the account has
been created by running::

    $ seth show account {address}

This will print out some information stored in state about your account. Since
this is not a contract account, there won't be a lot there but the address of
the account and the nonce of the account should be displayed.
