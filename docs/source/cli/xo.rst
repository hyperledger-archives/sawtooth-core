The ``xo`` command starts the XO transaction processor.

This command demonstrates an example client that uses the XO transaction
family to play a simple game of Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses,
or X's and O's). This command handles the construction and submission of
transactions to a running validator via the URL of the validator's REST API.

Before playing a game, you must start a validator, the XO transaction processor,and the REST API. The XO client sends requests to update and query the
blockchain to the URL of the REST API (by default, ``http://127.0.0.1:8008``).

For more information on requirements and game rules, see
:doc:`../app_developers_guide/intro_xo_transaction_family`.

The ``xo`` command provides subcommands for playing XO on the command line.
