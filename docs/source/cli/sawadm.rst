The ``sawadm`` command is used for Sawtooth administration tasks.
The ``sawadm`` subcommands create validator keys during
initial configuration and help create the genesis block when
initializing a validator.

sawadm genesis
==============

The ``sawadm genesis`` subcommand produces a file for use during the
initialization of a validator. A network requires an initial block (known as the
`genesis block`) whose signature will determine the block chain id. This initial
block is produced from a list of batches, which will be applied at
genesis time.

The optional argument `input_file` specifies one or more files containing
serialized ``BatchList`` protobuf messages to add to the genesis data. (Use a
space to separate multiple files.) If no input file is specified,
``sawadm keygen`` produces an empty genesis block.

The output is a file containing a serialized ``GenesisData`` protobuf message.
This file, when placed at `sawtooth_data`/``genesis.batch``, will trigger
the genesis process.

.. Note::

  The location of `sawtooth_data` depends on whether the
  environment variable ``SAWTOOTH_HOME`` is set. If it is, then
  `sawtooth_data` is located at ``SAWTOOTH_HOME/data``. If it is
  not, then `sawtooth_data` is located at ``/var/lib/sawtooth``.

When ``sawadm genesis`` runs, it displays the path and filename of the
target file where the serialized ``GenesisData`` is written. (Default:
`sawtooth_data`/``genesis.batch``.) For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sawadm genesis config.batch mktplace.batch
    Generating /var/lib/sawtooth/genesis.batch

Use ``--output`` `filename` to specify a different name for the target file.

sawadm keygen
=============

The ``sawadm keygen`` subcommand generates keys that the validator uses to
sign blocks. This system-wide key must be created during Sawtooth
configuration.

Validator keys are stored in the directory ``/etc/sawtooth/keys/``. By
default, the public-private key files are named ``validator.priv`` and
validator.pub. Use the <key-name> argument to specify a different file
name.
