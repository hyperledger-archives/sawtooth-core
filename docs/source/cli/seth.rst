Seth CLI
********

Overview
========

The seth command can be used to interact with the Seth
transaction family. It provides functionality for loading and executing smart
contracts, querying the data associated with a contract, and generating keys in
the format used by the tool. The following section reproduces the CLI usage
output obtained by running seth and its various subcommands with the `-h` flag.

See the final section for an explanation of how to generate contract
initialization data and how to format function calls using the Ethereum
Contract ABI.

Compiling Contracts
===================

The `seth load` command has a `--init` flag which takes a hex-encoded
byte array as an argument. This string is interpreted as the contract creation
code. To generate this string given a Solidity smart contract, the `solc`
compiler can be used. Assuming the contract is named `contract.sol`, the
command is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ solc --bin contract.sol

    ======= contract.sol:SimpleStorage =======
    Binary:
    6060604052341561000c57fe5b5b60c68061001b6000396000f30060606040526000357c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000900463ffffffff16806360fe47b11460445780636d4ce63c146061575bfe5b3415604b57fe5b605f60048080359060200190919050506084565b005b3415606857fe5b606e608f565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b806000819055505b50565b600060005490505b905600a165627a7a7230582042f71fb995ac3f6a4ce0560bae1342e5a54e96ec0462f812340a305e3c94da910029

The hex string that is output by this command can be passed directly to the
`--init` flag.

For more information on solc including how to install it and more advanced
usage, read the `Solidity Documentation`_.

.. _Solidity Documentation: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html

ABI Formatting
==============

The `seth exec` command has a `--data` flag which takes a hex-encoded byte
array as an argument. This string is interpreted according to the Ethereum
Contract ABI and, in the context of solidity, is used to select a function and
pass in arguments to that function.

One option for generating this string given a Solidity function is to use the
`ethereumjs-abi`_ library.

.. _ethereumjs-abi: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereumjs-abi

Given the solidity function `set(uint key, uint val) {...}` and the specific
call `set(19, 84)`, the commands to generate the byte array are:

.. code-block:: console

    $ node
    > var abi = require('ethereumjs-abi')
    > abi.simpleEncode("set(uint,uint)", "0x13", "0x54").toString("hex")
    '1ab06ee500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000130000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054'

The hex string that is output by this command can be passed directly to the
`--data` flag.
