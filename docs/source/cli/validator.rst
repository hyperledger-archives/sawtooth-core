**********************************
Validator CLI (sawtooth-validator)
**********************************

The validator CLI, ``sawtooth-validator``, controls the
behavior of the validator.

A validator is the component ultimately responsible for validating
batches of transactions, combining them into blocks, maintaining
consensus with the network, and coordinating communication between
clients, other validators, and transaction processors. Much of the
actual validation is delegated to other components, such as
transaction processors and the active consensus module.

sawtooth-validator
==================

The ``sawtooth-validator`` command starts the validator. Note the
following options which provide several ways to configure the
validator.

- Use the ``--peering`` option to set the peering type to ``dynamic``
  or ``static``.

  - If set to ``static``, use the ``--peers`` option to list the URLs
    of all peers that the validator should connect to, using the
    format ``tcp``://`hostname`:`port`. Specify multiple peer URLs in a
    comma-separated list.

  - If set to ``dynamic``, any static peers will be processed first,
    before starting the topology buildout starting, then the URLs
    specified by ``--seeds`` will be used for the initial connection
    to the validator network.

- Use ``--scheduler`` to set the scheduler type to ``serial`` or
  ``parallel``. Note that both scheduler types result in the same
  deterministic results and are completely interchangeable. However,
  parallel processing of transactions provides a performance
  improvement even for fast transaction workloads by reducing the
  overall latency effects that occur when transactions are processed
  serially.

- Use ``--network-auth`` to specify the required authorization
  procedure (``trust`` or ``challenge``) that validator connections
  must go through before they are allowed to participate on the
  network. To use network permissions, specify ``challenge``, which
  requires connections to sign a challenge so their identity can be
  proved.
