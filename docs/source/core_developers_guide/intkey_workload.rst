The Workload Generator
**********************

Overview
--------

Sawtooth has a workload generator that can be used to generate a
synthetic transaction workload.  The workload generator attempts to generate
transactions at a relatively steady rate across the network of validators that
are specified. In its simplest form, the workload generator is started as
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /project/sawtooth-core
    $ ./bin/intkey workload --urls tcp://127.0.0.1:4004 --rate 1 -d 5
    [21:09:15 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction submission rate for last sample period is 0.80 tps
    [21:09:15 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction commit rate for last sample period is 0.60 tps
    [21:09:15 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction submission rate for last 1 sample(s) is 0.80 tps
    [21:09:15 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction commit rate for last 1 sample(s) is 0.60 tps
    [21:09:20 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction submission rate for last sample period is 1.00 tps
    [21:09:20 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction commit rate for last sample period is 1.00 tps
    [21:09:20 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction submission rate for last 2 sample(s) is 0.90 tps
    [21:09:20 WARNING workload_generator] Transaction commit rate for last 2 sample(s) is 0.80 tps


Command-Line Options
--------------------

The workload generator has numerous command-line options, all of which can be
seen by executing the command with the ``--help`` (or ``-h``) command-line
option.

.. code-block:: console

    $ intkey workload -h
    usage: intkey workload [-h] [-v] [--rate RATE] [-d DISPLAY_FREQUENCY]
                       [-u URLS]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose         enable more verbose output
    --rate RATE           Batch rate in batches per second. Should be greater
                        then 0.
    -d DISPLAY_FREQUENCY, --display-frequency DISPLAY_FREQUENCY
                        time in seconds between display of batches rate
                        updates.
    -u URLS, --urls URLS  comma separated urls of validators to connect to.


The verbosity of the workload generator is controlled by the number of
occurrences of the ``--verbose`` (or ``-v``) option. For example, ``-vv``,
``-v -v``, and ``--verbose --verbose`` all would result in logging messages
with level DEBUG and above being displayed on the console.

The default batch rate, if it is not specified, is 10 batches per second.

The default display refresh frequency is 30 seconds.

The default url to connect to is `tcp://127.0.0.1:4004`.
