************************************************
Setting the Allowed Transaction Types (Optional)
************************************************

By default, a validator accepts transactions from any transaction processor.
However, Sawtooth allows you to limit the types of transactions that can be
submitted.

This setting, ``sawtooth.validator.transaction_families``, improves the
Sawtooth network's security by ignoring any unrecognized transaction processors.
It is an on-chain setting, which means that the change is submitted on one node;
the other nodes in the network apply the settings change when they receive the
block with this transaction. Note that the
:doc:`Settings transaction processor <../transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family>`
is required to handle on-chain configuration settings.

In this procedure, you will configure the validator network to limit the
accepted transaction types to those from the Identity, IntegerKey, Settings, and
PoET Validator Registry transaction processors.

.. important::

   For the environment described in this guide, you  **must** run this procedure
   on the same node that created the genesis block, because the ``sawset
   proposal create`` command requires the validator key that was generated on
   that node.

#. Open a terminal window on the "genesis node" (the Sawtooth node that created
   the genesis block in a previous procedure).

#. Use the ``sawset`` command to create and submit a batch of transactions that
   changes the allowed transaction types.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo sawset proposal create --key /etc/sawtooth/keys/validator.priv \
      sawtooth.validator.transaction_families='[{"family":"sawtooth_identity", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"intkey", "version": "1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_validator_registry", "version":"1.0"}]'

   This command sets ``sawtooth.validator.transaction_families`` to a JSON array
   that specifies the family name and version of each allowed transaction
   processor. For this information, see
   :doc:`transaction family specification <../transaction_family_specifications>`).

#. Run the following command to check the setting change.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sawtooth settings list

   The output should be similar to this example:

   .. code-block:: console

      sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.name: poet
      sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.version: 1.1.2
      sawtooth.poet.initial_wait_time: 15
      sawtooth.poet.key_block_claim_limit: 100000
      sawtooth.poet.report_public_key_pem: -----BEGIN PUBL...
      sawtooth.poet.target_wait_time: 15

#. You can also check the log file for the Settings transaction processor,
   ``/var/log/sawtooth/logs/settings-{xxxxxxx}-debug.log`` for a
   ``TP_PROCESS_REQUEST`` message. (Note that the Settings log file has a unique
   string in the file name.) The message will resemble this example:

   .. code-block:: none

      [20:07:58.039 [MainThread] core DEBUG] received message of type: TP_PROCESS_REQUEST
      [20:07:58.190 [MainThread] handler INFO] Setting setting sawtooth.validator.transaction_families changed from None to [{"family": "intkey", "version": "1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_validator_registry", "version":"1.0"}]'
