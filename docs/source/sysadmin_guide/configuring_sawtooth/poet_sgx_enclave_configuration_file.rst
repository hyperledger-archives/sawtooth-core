PoET SGX Enclave Configuration File
-----------------------------------

This configuration file specifies configuration settings for a PoET SGX enclave.

If the config directory contains a file named ``poet_enclave_sgx.toml``, the
configuration settings are applied when the component starts. (By default, the
config directory is ``/etc/sawtooth/``; see :doc:`path_configuration_file` for
more information.) Specifying a command-line option will override the setting
in the configuration file.

Note: By default, the config directory is /etc/sawtooth/.
See :doc:`path_configuration_file` for more information.

An example configuration file is in the ``sawtooth-core`` repository at
``/sawtooth-core/consensus/poet/sgx/packaging/poet_enclave_sgx.toml.example``.
To create a PoET SGX enclave configuration file, download this example file to
the config directory and name it ``poet_enclave_sgx.toml``. Then edit the file
to change the example configuration options as necessary for your system.

.. Note::

  See :doc:`../configure_sgx` for an example of changing settings in
  ``poet_enclave_sgx.toml`` when configuring Sawtooth with the SGX
  implementation of PoET.

The ``poet_enclave_sgx.toml`` configuration file has the following options:

- ``spid`` = '`string`'

  Specifies the Service Provider ID (SPID), which is linked to the key pair used
  to authenticate with the attestation service. Default: none. The SPID value
  is a 32-digit hex string tied to the enclave implementation; for example:

  .. code-block:: none

    spid = 'DEADBEEF00000000DEADBEEF00000000'

- ``ias_url`` = '`URL`'

  Specifies the URL of the Intel Attestation Service (IAS) server. Default:
  none. Note that the URL shown in ``poet_enclave_sgx.toml.example`` is an
  example server for debug enclaves only:

  .. code-block:: none

    ias_url = 'https://test-as.sgx.trustedservices.intel.com:443'

- ``spid_cert_file`` = '`/full/path/to/certificate.pem`'

  Identifies the PEM-encoded certificate file that was submitted to Intel in
  order to obtain a SPID. Default: none. Specify the full path to the
  certificate file. This pem file can be created from ``cert.crt`` and
  ``cert.key`` files with this command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cat cert.crt cert.key > cert.pem

  Or from ``cert.pfx`` file with following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -out cert.pem -nodes
