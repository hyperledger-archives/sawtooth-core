Sawtooth CLI Configuration File
-------------------------------

The Sawtooth CLI configuration file specifies arguments to be used by the
``sawtooth`` command and its subcommands. For example, you can use this
file to set the URL of the REST API once, rather than entering the ``--url``
option for each subcommand.

If the config directory contains a file named ``cli.toml``, the
configuration settings are applied when the ``sawtooth`` command is
run. (By default, the config directory is /etc/sawtooth/; see
:doc:`path_configuration_file` for more information.)
Specifying command-line options will override the settings in the
configuration file.

Note: By default, the config directory is /etc/sawtooth/.
See :doc:`path_configuration_file` for more information.

An example configuration file is in the ``sawtooth-core`` repository at
``/sawtooth-core/cli/cli.toml.example``. To create a CLI configuration
file, download this example file to the config directory and name it
``cli.toml``.

The example file shows the format of the ``url`` option. To use it,
uncomment the line and replace the default value with the actual
URL for the REST API.
