Hyperledger Sawtooth Core Developer's Setup Guide
=============

If you are planning to contribute code to the Sawtooth project, please review
the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Supported operating systems: Ubuntu 16.04 and macOS

If you want to use a Windows system, we recommend that you install Ubuntu 16.04
in a virtual machine manager, such as Hyper-V or VirtualBox, and develop from
the guest operating system.

**Note:** All commands in this guide use the Bash shell. While the Bash shell
is not strictly required as the command shell, many of the scripts in the build
system are Bash scripts and require Bash to execute.

Step One: Install Docker
-------------
The Sawtooth core requirements are:
- Docker Community Edition (version 17.05.0-ce or newer)
- Docker Compose (version 1.13.0 or newer)

Install the Docker software.

macOS:

- Install the latest version of Docker Engine for macOS:
  <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>

- On macOS, Docker Compose is installed automatically when you install Docker Engine.

Ubuntu:

- Install the latest version of Docker Engine for Linux: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu>

- Install Docker Compose: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

**Note:** The minimum version of Docker Engine necessary is 17.03.0-ce.
  Linux distributions often ship with older versions of Docker.

Next, add your username to the group `docker` to avoid having to run every
docker command as a `sudo`. (Otherwise, you will need to prefix each
command in Step Four, Step Five, and Step Six with `sudo`.)
Run the following command:

```bash
$ sudo adduser $USER docker
```

**Note:** If $USER is not set in the environment on your system, replace $USER in the previous command with your username.

You will need to log out and log back in to your system for the change in group membership to take effect.

Step Two: Configure Proxy (Optional)
-------------

If you are behind a network proxy, follow these steps before continuing.

**Important:** The URLs and port numbers shown below are examples only.
Use the actual URLs and port numbers for your environment.
Contact your network administrator for this information if necessary.

Run the following commands to set the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.

**Important:** Replace the example URLs and ports with the actual URLs and port numbers for your environment.

```bash
  $ export http_proxy=http://proxy-server.example:3128
  $ export https_proxy=http://proxy-server.example:3129
  $ export no_proxy=hostname1.com,.domainname1.com,*.domainname2.com,127.0.0.1
```

**Note:** Add these commands to either your `.profile` or `.bashrc` file
so you don't have to set them every time you open a new shell.

**Docker Proxy Settings (Optional)**

To configure Docker to work with an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, follow the
instructions for your operating system:

* macOS - See the instructions for proxy configuration in
  "Get started with Docker for Mac": <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/>

* Ubuntu - See the instructions for HTTP/HTTPS proxy configuration in
  "Control and configure Docker with systemd": <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#httphttps-proxy>

Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` with the
following contents:

**Important:** Replace the example URLs and ports with the actual URLs and port numbers for your environment.

```text
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy-server.example:3128" "HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.example:3129" "http_proxy=http://proxy-server.example:3128" "https_proxy=http://proxy-server.example:3129" "no_proxy=example.com,another-example.com,127.0.0.0"
```

**Restart Docker**

```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Verify that the configuration has been loaded:

```bash
$ systemctl show --property=Environment docker
Environment=HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy-server.example:80/
```

#### Docker DNS (Optional)

Docker build uses `/etc/resolv.conf` for setting up DNS servers for docker image
builds. If you receive `Host not found` errors during docker build steps,
you need to add nameserver entries to the `resolve.conf` file.

**Note:** (Ubuntu only)
Because `resolv.conf` is automatically generated on Ubuntu, you must
install a configuration utility with this command:

```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install resolvconf
```

Edit `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base` as root and add the DNS servers
for your network.

**Note:** If you are behind a firewall, you might need to use specific servers
for your network.

For example, to use Google's public DNS servers:

```
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

Step Three: Clone the Repository
-------------

**Note:** You must have `git` installed in order to clone the Sawtooth source
code repository. You can find up-to-date installation instructions
at "Getting Started - Installing Git": <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
   $ cd $HOME
   $ mkdir sawtooth
   $ cd sawtooth
   $ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core.git
```

Step Four: Build Docker Images
-------------

The Sawtooth build and test infrastructure requires that the dependencies be built.
These dependencies include the protocol buffers definitions (under the ``protos``
directory) for the target languages and a set of docker images with
the required build and runtime dependencies installed.

To build all the dependencies for running the full test-suite, run:

  ```bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker/compose/sawtooth-build.yaml up
  ```

**Note:** the `sawtooth-build` step above is a dependency for the automated test suite defined below.

To build the requirements to run a validator network, run this command:

  ```bash
    $ docker-compose build
  ```

This will build docker images suitable for running a validator, rest api,
settings transaction processor, intkey and xo python transaction processors,
and a client to interact with the network.

**Tip:** If you see `Host not found` errors in the output, see the
[Docker DNS(Optional)](#Docker-DNS-(Optional)) section above.

**Note:** This build environment uses Docker to virtualize the build and
to execute the code in the development directory. This allows you to
build and test the changes made to the local source without installing local
dependencies on your machine.

If you wish to configure your development machine to do compilation
directly on the host without Docker virtualization, see the `Dockerfile` in
any component directory. For example, the file
`sawtooth-core/validator/Dockerfile` describes the configuration and components
needed to build and run the validator on a system.

Also provided is a docker-compose file which builds a full set of images
with Sawtooth installed, and only the run-time dependencies installed.

  ```bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-installed.yaml build
  ```

These installed images also generate .deb artifacts during build. They can be found
in the `/tmp` dir in any of the images.

**Note:** Internet connection speeds vary. This build step may take some time. 

**Tip:** There are also possible errors during Docker builds, like transient
 issues for downloads. An example is the protobuf download from Github step.
 If the download results in an incomplete/corrupt archive, the build process 
 will exit `non-zero code: 9`.

Step Five: Start a Validator Node
-------------

To run a full validator node from the local source:

```bash
  $ docker-compose up
```

This command starts a validator with the following components attached to it:

  - REST API (available on host port 8008)
  - IntKey transaction processor (Python implementation)
  - Settings transaction processor
  - XO transaction processor (Python implementation)
  - Shell (for running Sawtooth commands)

From another console window, you can access the shell with this command:

```bash
  $ docker-compose exec client bash
```

This command uses Docker Compose and the development Docker images. These
images have the runtime dependencies installed, but run Sawtooth
from the source in your workspace. You can inspect
`docker-compose.yaml` to see how the various components are
launched and connected.

Step Six: Run Automated Tests
-------------

**Note:** The automated tests rely on Docker to ensure reproducibility.
You must have Docker images that were built with the
`docker-compose -f docker/compose/sawtooth-build.yaml up` command
as described above.

To run the automated tests for Python components, while excluding
Rust components:

```bash
  $ bin/run_tests -x rust_sdk
```

**Note:** The `run_tests` command provides the ``-x`` flag to allow you to exclude
various components from the tests. You can also specify which tests to run
with the ``-m`` flag. Run the command `run_tests -h` for help.
